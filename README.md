While working on this project, I struggled to configure my GitHub account properly in VS Code. It took some trial and error, but I eventually got it working by learning more about SSH keys and Git settings.

Another challenge was with the tip calculator program â€” I initially forgot that I needed to convert the percentage input into a decimal. This caused incorrect results, but I learned that dividing the percentage by 100 (e.g., float(percent) / 100) is essential for accurate calculations.

Both issues helped me better understand version control and basic Python logic. Mistakes became learning opportunities!
